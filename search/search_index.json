If you don't have one, you can use Google Colab, which provides nvidia T4 for free. </p> <p>We will use learning framework <code>pytorch</code> and its <code>torchvision</code> library. About how to install them locally, referring this link. Install other necessary libraries. </p> <p>In addition to this, you still need download two files:</p> <ol> <li>Testset (testset.pt), which includes 100 images and their corresponding correct labels ((input_imgs, labels)). Each image is a tensor with shape 3\\times 32 \\times 32 (32 is the width and height of the image, and each pixel has 3 channels-red, green and blue). Each label is a single integer, which is the label. You need eventually made some minor perturbations to these images.</li> <li>ResNet Network (resnet.model), which is a classification neural network. It receives an image tensor and will generate an output with size <code>1000</code>. Each term in this torch indicates the probability that this image predicted by this model is the corresponsing labels. </li> </ol>"},{"location":"#algorithms","title":"Algorithms","text":"<p>We will introduce two adversarial training algorithms-fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and projected gradient descent (PGD).

Therefore, the finally submitted object should be <code>List[torch.tensor]</code> with \\text{length}=100, containing 100 adversarial images (the order should keep the same as the <code>testset</code>).

Therefore, if you submit an incorrect file, you would receive low or zero grades. Double check your file before submitting and you can also write your self-check script to test your result. </p>"},{"location":"#grade-policy","title":"Grade Policy","text":"<p>Our test meets several guidelines:</p> <ol> <li>Less \\epsilon, higher grade. If you make less perturbation to the original image, you would receive a higher grade. If you increase your \\epsilon, your modification will then be easier to see. Your grade will drop exponentially with \\epsilon.</li> <li>Higher predicted difference, higher grade. If you acheive a higher mis-prediction rate on your adversarial samples, you would receive a higher grade. Your grade will increase linearly with the mis-prediction rate.</li> </ol> <p>Specifically, we would calculate three values for your ddversarial sampls:</p> <ol> <li>\\epsilon, which is the average difference between your submitted samples and original images (unit in pixel). In FGSM, this \\epsilon shoud be the same as your <code>eps</code>. In PGD, \\epsilon should be lower than <code>eps</code> you set in the algorithm as <code>eps</code> is the upperbound. </li> <li><code>tp1-accuracy-diff</code>: </li> <li>Top-1 accuracy is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a model. Given an image, the model outputs the probabilities for 1,000 labels. The label with the highest probability is referred to as the top-1 prediction. If this prediction matches the actual label, it is considered a True Positive. Using this, we can calculate the accuracy as \\text{tp1-acc} = \\frac{TP}{100}.</li> <li>We will calcualate the top-1 accuracy for both original dataset and your dataset and use |\\text{tp1-accuray-original} - \\text{tp1-accuracy-yours}| as <code>tp1_accuracy_diff</code>. A higher Top-1 accuracy difference means that your adversarial examples make it more difficult for the model to produce correct predictions, indicating that your adversarial learning algorithm is more successful.</li> <li><code>tp5-accuracy-diff</code>:</li> <li>Top-1 accuracy is essentially the same as accuracy. It's somehow too strict. You can turn out picking the most 5 highest prediction values from the probability instead of the highest one, and if any one of them matches the desirable label, we count them as a true positive, we can get Top-5 accuracy. </li> <li>We would also calculate the Top-5 accuracy difference for our grading. </li> </ol> <p>We will use following formula to calculate your grades:</p> <p>For FGSM, you will get the score according the maximum grade you get. </p>  \\text{TP1 Score} = 0.33 + 33\\times \\text{tp1-accuracy-diff} - e^{33\\times eps}\\\\ \\text{TP5 Score} = 66\\times \\text{tp5-accuracy-diff} - e^{33\\times eps}\\\\ \\text{Final Score} = \\text{min}(\\text{max}(\\text{max}(\\text{TP1 Score}, \\text{TP5 Score}), 0), 10)  <p>For PGD, you will get the score according to the minimum grade you get.</p>  \\text{TP1 Score} = 26\\times \\text{tp1-accuracy-diff} - e^{66\\times eps}\\\\ \\text{TP5 Score} = 46\\times \\text{tp5-accuracy-diff} - e^{66\\times eps}\\\\ \\text{Final Score} = 0.2\\times \\text{min}(\\text{max}(\\text{min}(\\text{TP1 Score}, \\text{TP5 Score}), 0), 10)  <p>PGD algorithm is more powerful and you can see it's more strict to \\epsilon. </p> <p>You can submit for FGSM for 10 TIMES amd 3 TIMES for PGD.
